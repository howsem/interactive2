The celebrated Combines, begun in the mid-19'50s, brought real-world images and objects into the realm of abstract painting and countered sanctioned divisions between painting and sculpture. These works established the artist's ongoing dialogue between mediums, between the handmade and the readymade, and between the gestural brushstroke and the mechanically reproduced image. Rauschenberg's lifelong commitment to collaboration-with performers, printmakers, engineers, writers, artists, and artisans from around the world-is a further manifestation of his expansive artistic philosophy.
